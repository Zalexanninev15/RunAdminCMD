# RunAdminCMD

## Description
Utility for running files and scripts as an Administrator. Created to quickly grant Administrator rights to bat and cmd files.
## How to interact?
1. In the "cmd.cfg" file, enter the path to the file (in the first line) that needs Administrator rights (it is better to just put the desired file in the folder with the utility and just write the file name of this file).
2. Run the file "RunAdminCMD.exe" and give Administrator rights
